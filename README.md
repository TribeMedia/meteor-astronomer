# astronomerio:core meteor package

This package automatically sends events from your Meteor app (route hits and Meteor.method calls) to Astronomer. 

It's under active development, not ready for prime-time yet. Email ry@rywalker.com if you'd like to apply to participate in our closed alpha, which should begin late June.
